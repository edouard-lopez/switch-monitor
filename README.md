# About
This is a small bash script to **move a window between monitors** on a distro with the _X Window System_.

For some reason, in a number of distros, there is no built-in way to configure a keyboard shortcut to move a window from one monitor to another.

In Mint, there are keyboard shortcut options for moving to an _edge_, which can be used to to move non-maximized window to the left edge of the left-most monitor or right edge of the right-most monitor.  However, there are limitations to this approach.

There are other scripts floating around, but I have not found one that works quite right with `F11` fullscreen (as opposed to _maximized_) windows, nor one that supports three or more monitors.  Also, this script should detect (horizontal) monitor sizes and left-right order for you. 


## Dependencies

This script uses `xdotool`, `wmctrl`, `xwininfo`, and `xprop`.  In _Linux Mint_ and _Ubuntu_, you'll probably only need to install `xdotool`.  In other distros you may need to install others.


# Install

To install, place the script in a desired location, make sure it's executable:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ntowbinj/switch-monitor.git
chmod +x switch-monitor/switch-monitors.sh
```

# Usage

Running the script with no arguments will move the current window to the right.  Running it with a positive or negative integer argument will move it right or left by so many monitors:

```bash
./switch-monitor.sh -3
```

# Configuration 

Then edit _Keyboard Settings_ â†’ _Keyboard Shortcuts_ and add a custom shortcut that executes this script upon the desired keypressing, either by supplying an absolute path to the script (or by putting the script on your `PATH`). I use `Ctrl+m`.

If you have more than one monitor and would like to move it in more than one direction, you could set up an alternate keypressing for the command `switch-monitor.sh -1`.
